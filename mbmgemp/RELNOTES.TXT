Please contact with me thoughts and suggestions.

=== 0.2 === in progress

0.2 will focus on NPC behavior:
* A legacy Galactic Empire bug that keeps Cybs from pursuing you if
  you are the only player logged in should be resolved.

A bug that sometimes showed the wrong defaults in the planetary
administration menu should be resolved.

=== 0.1.1 === 2026-09-30:

Some silly bugs involving the sell command, wrong degrees showing,
absolute rotation not working with warp command, and a few other
things fixed.

printmap and printmapfull use color codes more efficiently.

=== 0.1 ===

Welcome to the first release of ge-next built from source.
ge-next 0.1 WILL REQUIRE A GAME RESET.

PLANETS:
* All ships can now attack with troops. Attacking with fighters remains
limited to certain classes of ships only.
* Men now eat every planetary cycle as troops do, which didn't happen in
GE classic although it was apparently the intended behavior. This obviously
changes the amount of food that planet owners need to grow. You can set
MENEAT in MBMGEMS.MSG to NO to revert to the Galactic Empire 3.2e behavior.
* Default rate of food production raised by 1.5x since men are eating now.
* If you reach the planetary maximum on an item, you will stop getting
messages that you've reached the maximum once you set production for
that item to 0.
* Planetary cash and tax are capped at 4,294,967,295 and can no longer
overflow.
* When ADMINing a planet for the first time, all items automatically have
their price set to base prices.
* When ADMINing a planet that has been previously owned and abandoned,
the exisiting settings are kept.
* When editing an item on the admin screen, it will show you the existing
value and you can now press enter to keep the current value.

ITEMS:
* The BUY, SELL, and TRANSFER commands now take "ALL" and "MAX" as arguments
in addition to numerical amounts. "ALL" is for all onboard or on a planet,
whereas "MAX" will fill your ship.
* The TRANSFER command now lets you specify "u" or "d" instead of typing out
"up" or "down."
* The PRICE command now properly shows the base price of an item when you
own the planet.
* The PRICE command will tell you the price of the specified amount of
items even if you can't hold that many.
* Several checks and improvements to how large amounts of items and weights
are handled and displayed.

NAVIGATION:
* You can now use absolute rotation (@) with the WARP and IMPULSE commands. 
* If your ship is in the process of rotating, and you enter a warp or
impulse command without a heading change, the rotation in process will
continue.
* The acceleration routine has been modified to work with ships with
acceleration rates under 1000 (e.g. Planetary Transport). 
* Helm will announce the new sector when you go through a wormhole or use SYS
GOTO.
* Bug that showed "helm is damaged" (when it's not) if entering an invalid
degree value with the WARP command fixed.
* Orbit planet message will not try to display the name of an unnamed planet.
* Your ship name will now display in messages such as the "entering
hyperspace" message.
* If you try to rotate to a heading that you are already heading, the helm
will report you're already heading that heading.

REPORTS:
* All reports have been cleaned up with proper spacing and alignment.
* Ships without phasers or shields don't list them in reports.
* Warp engine damage, fire control damage, and phaser damage now listed in
REP SYS.

SCANS:
* For planets, the population for planets you don't own is now represented as
thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions, etc.
* Mine stockpile size is shown instead of food.
* If you are orbiting an unowned planet, the scan will show the entire
inventory just like it does when you own it.
* The amounts that are considered moderate and large stockpiles were raised.

SYSOP/ADMIN:
* No registration number required, feel free to enter any eight-digit
number for the REGNO. All registration/security checks removed.
* New sysop command: SYS MULTIPLY -- run planetary cycle for planet you
are orbiting, up to 50 times.
* New sysop command: SYS ORBIT -- orbit planet in current sector even
if you're not next to it.
* New sysop command: SYS MIDNIGHT -- run midnight routine, for debugging
only.
* The option to use BBS e-mail as opposed to the in-game message system has
been removed.
* The default for option MAXPLSE, the maximum amount of planets in a sector,
was 5 but only created four planets maximum. This has been fixed, and the
default lowered to 4 to make it effectively what it was before.
* Cleaned up the sysop commands and moved the messages from them into the
MSG files. You still can't view the help for them if you don't have access.
* Streamlined the messages in the MSG files and remove unused and
redundant messages.

COMBAT:
* If phasers are damaged, hyperphasers are also inoperable.
* If phasers are damaged and you try to use them, a message will now be
displayed indicating they are damaged instead of just saying they have
insufficient power.
* If you have enough torpedoes, mines, etc. deployed that you can't deploy
any more, the error message will now tell you what the maximum is.

MISC:
* A brand new, much more readable, HELP CLASS screen.
* SCANNAMES and SCANFULL settings are now ON by default when a new player
enters. They can still be turned off.
* Cash is now displayed as unsigned, meaning cash can be a value of up to
4,294,967,295. The SELL command, NEW command, cash awarded after user kill,
and tax collection from a planet now all have checks to make sure you don't
exceed this amount.
* If you've been traveling over the recommended warp speed long enough that
your top speed has been lowered, and you change speed, you're now only
lowered to the new top speed if you choose a speed over the new top speed.
* Roster cleaned up and re-spaced so huge population values won't explode
the columns. "ROS ALL" now also shows users with 0 score.
* You can now enter "x" at the ship selection screen to go back to the main
menu in case you decide you don't want to play after all.
* Cleaned up how the galactic perimeter is established. You can now travel
all the way to (default) 300 300, you are only bounced back after trying to
pass that. If you have wraparound on, it now wraps to the correct sector
(e.g. 300 to -300).
* Changed the CYBNEW and DROIDNEW announcments to show the sector of the
newly created ship, as opposed to the (fake) bearing.
* Changed "spy" to be "spies" so it's plural like all other items. Also
changed the amount of letters you have to use to buy/sell/ transfer spies
to two, so you can now enter or "spy" or "spies."
* If you are damaged by the enforcer planet or the galactic boundary, the
message will display the actual level of damage applied.

COMING IN FUTURE VERSIONS:
* New bad guys and improved behavior
* Refinements to planetary attack
* Refinements to planetary item production
* Refinements to combat
* New capabilities for owned planets that can be purchased with planet cash
(e.g. remote administration)
* Lots of item balancing to keep long running games competitive
* Much, much more

=== 0.09 === 2024-09-06:
Version 0.09 is not for release and is the initial publication of source code
to Github. The release version will be 0.1.

=== 0.02 === 2024-09-05:
Version 0.02 released. This fixes some color bugs in the admin screen. This
will probably be the last release before 0.1, which will be the first version
compiled from source.

=== 0.01 ===:
As of now, ge-next is simply a drop-in replacement of configuration files
that run on a standard installation of Galactic Empire 3.2e. Future versions
will be compiled from source and contain bugfixes, optimizations, quality of
life improvements, and new features.

Please take a look at what's new and share your feedback.

What's new:

A brand new collection of user ships, 16 in total. I've tried to make each
ship unique and useful, and to have interesting options for both players
who are starting out and players that have accumulated loads of cash. (I
have not reworked the Cybertrons yet, but that's coming.)

A complete reworking of the game messages and color codes for a more uniform
appearance. All messages have explicitly set color codes which will prevent
the text fading and other color bugs in the original. Spelling and
punctuation fixes. Messages from the ship are labeled "ERROR," "CAUTION,"
and "WARNING!" as appropriate. (The helm officer has retired.)

A new game instruction screen and backstory, setting this game 30 years
beyond the original. Future versions of ge-next will expand the backstory a
bit.

Reformatted and updated all the help screens, including the HELP CLASS xx
screens for each user ship type. A lot of the help screens in 3.2e had
outdated information that changed during the game's development, so I did a
bit of rewriting but tried not to stray too much from the original.

Slightly lowered shield and phaser prices so they would all fit under the
200m limit, and updated HELP NEWPRICE to match.

Other little tweaks ;)
