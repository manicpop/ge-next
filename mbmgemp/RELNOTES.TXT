=== 0.09 === 2024-09-06:
Version 0.09 is not for release and is the initial publication of source
code to Github. The release version will be 0.1.

=== 0.02 === 2024-09-05:
Version 0.02 released. This fixes some color bugs in the admin
screen. This will probably be the last release before 0.1, which will be
the first version compiled from source.

=== 0.01 ===:

Welcome to the initial release of ge-next, an updated and expanded version of
the classic MajorBBS game Galactic Empire.

As of now, ge-next is simply a drop-in replacement of configuration files that
run on a standard installation of Galactic Empire 3.2e. Future versions will
be compiled from source and contain bugfixes, optimizations, quality of life
improvements, and new features.

Please take a look at what's new and share your feedback. Thanks to testers
Archwiki and zaphbeeble.

What's new:

A brand new collection of user ships, 16 in total. I've tried to make each ship
unique and useful, and to have interesting options for both players who are
starting out and players that have accumulated loads of cash. (I have not
reworked the Cybertrons yet, but that's coming.)

A complete reworking of the game messages and color codes for a more uniform
appearance. All messages have explicitly set color codes which will prevent
the text fading and other color bugs in the original. Spelling and
punctuation fixes. Messages from the ship are labeled "ERROR," "CAUTION,"
and "WARNING!" as appropriate. (The helm officer has retired.)

A new game instruction screen and backstory, setting this game 30 years beyond
the original. Future versions of ge-next will expand the backstory a bit.

Reformatted and updated all the help screens, including the HELP CLASS xx
screens for each user ship type. A lot of the help screens in 3.2e had
outdated information that changed during the game's development, so I did a bit
of rewriting but tried not to stray too much from the original.

Slightly lowered shield and phaser prices so they would all fit under the
200m limit, and updated HELP NEWPRICE to match.

Other little tweaks ;)

No changes are set in stone so please contact me with your thoughts.

Installation:

== 0.02 does not require a game reset if you were running 0.01 ==

Simply replace Galactic Empire 3.2e's MBMGEHLP.MSG, MBMGEMNU.TXT,
MBMGEMSG.MSG, and MBMGESHP.MSG with the versions in this zip file. If you have
an existing installation that has been running, reset the game by copying all
*.NEW files over the *.DAT files in the directory (and delete *.DB files if
running on MBBSEmu). Back up the old files if you wish first. Make sure to
set REGNO in MBMGEMSG.MSG to the same REGNO as your exisiting installation.
