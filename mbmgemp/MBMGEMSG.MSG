This Option is maintained for backward compatibility and
has no effect in Version 6+ of MajorBBS. If you are using
a 5.xx version set this to the descriptive name on the
main menu you wish associated with GE.

GEMNU {Galactic Empire} S 30 Main menu description

This Option is maintained for backward compatibility and
has no effect in Version 6+ of MajorBBS. If you are using
a 5.xx version set this to the Selection Letter associated
with GE.

GESEL {The main menu selection: G} C

Set this option on if you wish to enable the optional menu
text page.
 
OPTMENU {Enable the optional menu selection: YES} B

This is the text of the menu description. The menu
will appear as...

   OPTCHR ... OPTTXT       or
   C ... Chronicles of Zygor

OPTTXT {Release notes} S 30 Text menu selection

This is the menu selection character for the optional
menu.

OPTCHR {Optional menu character: N} C

You can limit the number of players who can simultaneously
play the game. You may with to set this value in order to
keep your systems performance within an acceptable
response.  The more players in the game the more CPU
resources the game consumes.

MAXPLRS {The maximum players in the game at once: 32} N 1 256

This option controls if non-paying players can enter the
game.  Set to 1 to allow non-paying players to pay, 0 to
restrict.

NOTE: In release 6.0 this field has no effect. Please
control this feature with the PLAYKEY field in the
Level 3 Security Options.

FREEBIES {If 1 non-payers can play, otherwise set to 0: 0} N 0 1

Set this value to control the number of TOP PLAYERS
displayed in the roster.

MAXLIST {The number of entries shown in the roster: 10} N 3 50

Set this value to control the maximum number of ships a 
player can have at the same. 

MAXSHIPS {The maximum number of ships a player can own: 32} N 1 50

Set this value to control the maximum number of planets a
player can own at the same time. 

MAXPLNTS {Maximum planets a single player can own? 200} N 1 256

This value controls the maximum planets that will be created 
at one time in a sector. Reducing this number reduces the 
total planets in the game and the system load to create and
manage them. If you are having performance problems when 
planets are created you should reduce this number to
limit the disk I/O each time. There is no problem changing
this value AFTER a game has begun.


MAXPLSE {Maximum planets in a sector? 4} N 1 9

If a player tries to attack another player in the Neutral
Zone they will be fired upon by the Enforcer planet. Set
this to the amount of damage inflicted each time this 
occurs.

NOTE- set SE100DAM to 101 to kill violators in 1 shot

SE100DAM {The amt of damage when hostile in Neutral: 10} N 0 101

Set this option on if you wish the MajorBBS's profanity
filters to be monitored during the game.

PROFON {Do you want profanity checking on? NO} B

This option turns on some optional logging generally used
for debugging purposes. It is recommended that it remain 0
unless instructed to change it by our support staff.

0 = show minimal log messages
1 = show operational information messages
2 = show diagnostic messages
3 = show debugging messages

SHOWOPT {Show on log "GE:" messages at which level? 0} N 0 5

This option turns on extended trace logging generally used
for debugging purposes. It is recommended that it remain NO
unless instructed to change it by our support staff.

If enabled output is sent to GEOUT.LOG. Note, this file can
grow quite large if this option is left on.

LOGFLG {Enable extended trace logging? NO} B

This option specifies the filename of the user database. It
is provided to you in case you wish to store the datafiles
in a seperate directory.

GEUSER {MBMGEUSR.DAT} S 40 GE User Filename

This option specifies the filename of the Ship database. It
is provided to you in case you wish to store the datafiles
in a seperate directory.

GESHIP {MBMGESHP.DAT} S 40 GE Ship Filename

This option specifies the filename of the Mail database. It
is provided to you in case you wish to store the datafiles
in a seperate directory.

GEMAIL {MBMGEMAL.DAT} S 40 GE Mail Filename

This option specifies the filename of the planet database. It
is provided to you in case you wish to store the datafiles
in a seperate directory.

GEPLNT {MBMGEPLT.DAT} S 40 GE Planet Filename

This option specifies the filename of the current active
ship class table. Do not change this filename in the 
middle of a contest. If you do change it you must reset
the MBMGESHP.DAT and MBMGEUSR.DAT databases.

GESHIPCL {MBMGESHP.MCV} S 28 GE Ship Class Message Filename

This option controls if a player is allowed to transfer
goods to a planet which they do not own. If YES a player
can transfer goods to another players planets. This could
give players with multiple USERID's an unfair advantage as
they could transfer goods from multiple accounts to a
single account giving that account an initial boost in the
game. 

Note: If you only permit paying accounts to play the game
this is of less concern.

TRANSOPT {Allow goods transfers to planets not owned? YES} B

This option enables the special SYSOP commands. It is
STRONGLY recommended that you only turn this on when
specifically needed and leave it off otherwise.

SYSCMDS {Allow sysop commands? YES} B

If sysop commands are enabled are they restricted to
players with SYSOP class only.

SYSONLY {Allow sysop only to use sysop commands? YES} B

This option controls the Dynamic Planet Update Feature.
The system will monitor how long it takes to process 
through all the planets in the galaxy and dynamically
adjust the update frequency to keep the total cycle time as
close to the time below as it can.

Caution: Setting this value too small will cause the system
to consume more CPU time than may be available.  It is
recommended that this value be set to 6 hours (360
minutes) which will cause four updates a day.

PLANTOCK {How long to take to update all planets (minutes)? 360} N 1 32760

This value controls the odds of a sector having 
planets. The lower the number the more likely
a sector will have planets.

PLODDS {Frequency Factor for planets: 3} N 1 20

This value controls the odds of a sector having
a wormhole. The lower the number the more likely
a sector will have a wormhole.

WORMODDS {Frequency Factor for wormholes: 6} N 1 100

Depending upon your CPU's performance you can have up to
256 additional Robotic Ships (Automatons) in the game. 

Caution: This value can DRAMATICALLY effect CPU 
performance. If you are not confident about your specific
system please set to a lower value at first and experiment
with increased values as you evaluate your CPU's
performance.

NUMSHIPS {The number of additional ships (robots) in game? 32} N 0 500

This value limits the number of DROID class ships
insuring that there are plenty of CYBS for players.
Recommended setting is half of NUMSHIPS.

MAXDROID {Max droid class ships in game: 8} N 0 500

This value controls how far from the center (sector 0 0) 
the galaxy extends. The Galaxy is square and UNIVMAX
sectors in each direction (N,S,E,W).

NOTE: The size has some pretty dramatic effects on the
game. You may with to try various values in each of your
campaigns to determine which works best for you. 

DO NOT CHANGE THIS VALUE WITHOUT RESETTING ALL THE GALACTIC
EMPIRE DATABASES AS UNEXPECTED PROBLEMS -WILL- OCCUR!!!

UNIVMAX {The radius of the Virtual Galaxy: 300} N 10 32000


This option controls whether the galaxy wraps or has a
"bumper". If YES then it wraps around top to bottom, and
side to side.

UNIVWRAP {Does the Galaxy wrap around? NO} B

This value controls how large the GEPLANET.DAT data file
will grow to. Each time a sector is "teraformed" the 
GEPLANET.DAT database grows by the following formula; 
space added = (number planets * 512) + 512

In order to prevent your disk from filling up you can
specify the maximum size that the database will grow to in
Kbytes. When the maximum is reached no more planets will be
created. Note: a 32,767 database will hold 65,535 planets
and sectors. That should keep most players busy for awhile.

MAXPLREC {Max size of GEPLANET.DAT in Kbytes: 32767} N 10 32767

This option controls the range of the Torpedo Lock-on
function. It functions as a divisor to reduce the effective
range down from the maximum possible range of 50,000. The
specific formula for those who want to know is as follows;

IF (1.2-(speed/5000))*((5-distance)/(TORFACT/10))
IS GREATER THAN .7 LOCKON SUCCESSFUL

speed = opponents speed
distance = opponents distance (in sectors)

NOTE: Valid range is between 1 and 50.

TORFACT {Torpedo Lock-on divisor: 40} N 1 50

This option sets the maximum damage % a torpedo can 
do. It is factored in the game later with a random 
multiplier between .5 and 1.0 giving each torpedo a
damage factor between 50% and 100% of the value you 
specify here.

TDAMMAX {Torpedo Damage Maximum: 35} N 1 100

This option controls the speed of a torpedo. 
It is the distance the torpedo goes each "tic"
which is about 5 seconds.

TORPSPED {Speed of torpedo: 2441} N 1 10000

This option controls the range of the Missile Lock-on
function. It functions as a divisor to reduce the effective
range down from the maximum possible range of 50,000. The
specific formula for those who want to know is as follows;

IF ((5-distance)/(MISFACT/10))
IS GREATER THAN .7 LOCKON SUCCESSFULL

speed = opponents speed
distance = opponents distance 

NOTE: Valid range is between 1 and 50.

MISFACT {Missile Lock-on divisor: 21} N 1 50

This option sets the maximum damage % a missile can 
do. It is factored in the game later with a random 
multiplier between .5 and 1.0 and the power of the
missile. The exact formula is...
damage = (MDAMMAX/100)*(50000/missile power)*
         (random(.5)+.5);

MDAMMAX {Missile Damage Maximum: 25} N 1 100

This option controls the speed of a missile. 
It is the distance the missile goes each "tic"
which is about 5 seconds.

MISLSPED {Speed of missile: 1212} N 1 10000

This value controls the ratio of energy 
imparted to a missile to the energy extracted
from the flux pod. Default value is 10. A 
missile charge of 50000 consumes 5000 from the
flux. Set to 1 to get a 1 to 1 ratio.

MISENGFC {Missile Energy usage ratio: 100} N 1 2000

This option controls the maximum damage an Ion
Cannon can do each shot. It is factored in the 
game by a random multiplier of .5 to 1.0 giving
a maximum damage of 50% to 100% of IDAMMAX.

IDAMMAX {Maximum damage from Ion Cannon: 50} N 1 100

This option specifies the maximum number of 
mines which can be "ticking" at the same 
time. 

CAUTION: This option can dramatically effect 
CPU usage. Change carefully.

NUMMINES {Number of Mines "ticking": 18} N 1 200

This option specifies the maximum number of 
mines which a single user can lay at the same 
time. 


USRMINES {Number of Mines a user can lay: 3} N 1 200

This option controls the maximum damage a Mine
can do. It is factored later in the game by the 
distance from the ship. 


MNDAMMAX {Maximum damage a Mine can do: 75} N 1 200

This option controls the odds of a decoy snagging
a missile or torpedo. If the distance from the 
incoming object is less than 5000 then there is a 
one in DECODDS chance the decoy will snag it each
tic (every 5 seconds) cycle.

DECODDS {Odds of a decoy decoying: 11} N 1 20

This option controls the rate at which spontaneous repairs
occur to a damaged ship. The value is specified in 
percent of damage reduced each cycle. 

Values above 10 are not recommended as repairs would 
occur so fast that it might be too difficult to kill
a ship.

REPAIRRT {Rate of repair in %: 6} N 1 50

This option controls the effective distance of the 
Hyperphasers. Decrease to extend their range, 
increase to shorten.

HPFIRDST {Hyperphaser distance factor: 5} N 1 20

This option controls the amount of damage a hyperphaser
does. Increase to cause more damage per shot, decrease
to reduce. Because this is factored down by range and
phaser type you can set the value to numbers greater
than 100.

HPDAMMAX {Hyperphaser maximum damage: 50} N 1 200

This option controls the effective distance of the 
Hyperphasers. Decrease to extend their range, 
increase to shorten.

PFIRDST {Phaser distance factor: 5} N 1 20

This option controls the amount of damage a phaser
does. Increase to cause more damage per shot, decrease
to reduce. Because this is factored down by range and
phaser type you can set the value to numbers greater
than 100.

PDAMMAX {Phaser maximum damage: 50} N 1 200

This option controls what class of phasers can fire
from Impulse to Warp. The default is 3. To make all
classes of phasers have this capability set it to 0.
To make none set it to 17.

PHATOWRP {Phasers to Warp Minimum Type: 3} N 0 20

This option controls the duration of a jammer.
It is factored in the game by the distance 
from the ship that launches it.

JAMTIME {How long do Jammers last: 3} N 1 10

This option specifies how much energy the cloaking system
draws during each tick cycle. 

CLENGUSE {How much does Cloak draw each tick: 5000} N 1 32000

This option controls whether or not men eat food like
troops do. YES is default for ge-next, set to NO to
use the behavior from Galactic Empire 3.2e.

MENEAT {Do men eat? YES} B

This option controls how many days mail messages
are queued before deletion.

MAILDAYS {How many days to save mail: 3} N 1 7

This option sets the amount of cash each player starts 
with when they begin the game. It is specified in thousands.

STRTCASH {How much cash does a player start with (in 1000's): 100} N 1 32000

This bonus is awarded for killing the top player 
in the roster. Half this for number 2, 1/3 this
for number 3...etc. This gives players a huge 
incentive to kill the top dog.

SCRBONUS {Max Bonus for killing top scoring player: 1000} N 1 32700

This factor calculates the percent of the winners 
award to deduct from the loser. Example: If John
kills Pete, and John gets 1000 points Pete will
lose 100 points given the default value of 10%

SCRFACT {Factor points to deduct from loser: 35} N 1 100

This option will determine if and how much to charge
a player as a fine when they lose a battle to another 
player. This only happens when "live" players battle.
The amount is a percent to charge the loser and award
to the winner. The fee is deducted from the players
cash. Setting to 0 disables this option.

CHGLOSER {Percent to fine a loser: 2} N 0 100

This option specifies the distance Cyb's will allow 
non-combative classes of ships to approach before they
consider the approach an aggressive act. This value is
modified in the code using the following formula on a
case by case basis.

distance = TOOCLOSE + random(TOOCLOSE)

The range is therefore TOOCLOSE to 2*TOOCLOSE

TOOCLOSE {How close do Cybs allow players to get: 2500} N 1 32000

This option specifies the upper limit of the 
random gold given to a Cyb each time they
are created. Increase this value if you 
would like to put more value in shooting
down cybs.

CYBGOLD {Max amount of gold a cyb gets: 1200} N 0 32000

This option controls when the cybertrons invoke
hyperwarp. If the player is more than HYPDST1 sectors
away the cybertron will go to hyperwarp to get
there faster. 

CAUTION: This number MUST be larger than HYPDST2.

HYPDST1 {Max Cybertron Hyperwarp distance: 25} N 1 32000

This option controls when the cybertrons drop out of
hyperwarp. If the player is less than HYPDST2 sectors
away the cybertron will drop to normal speed.

CAUTION: This number MUST be smaller than HYPDST1.

HYPDST2 {Min Cybertron Hyperwarp distance: 10} N 1 32000

This option controls the bonus amount added to the
team score for each member. It adds value to the 
score for having more players in a team. The value
specified below is in 100's.

TEAMBONU {Team bonus added for each plyr: 5} N 0 32000

This option specifies the maximum number of members on
a given team. Keeping this number lower will prevent 
everyone flocking to a popular team and winning by 
sheer numbers alone. It also forces the existing team
members to be selective on who they let join the team.

TEAMMAX {Maximum members on a team: 10} N 0 32000

This option specifies the number of planets in the neutral
zone (sector 0 0). 

Note: You need not change this unless you want more than 
3 planets in the Neutral Zone. 

If you turn on an additional planet you MUST change 
this option to reflect the number of planets.
The planets are only created the FIRST TIME a player
scans the Neutral Zone.

This option specifies the divisor for each of the
ITMVLnn options above. By adjusting the divisor 
you can increase or decrease the point weight of 
all items in the table uniformly

The formula is as follows;

Point = ((number items)/PLTVDIV) * ITMVLnn

This value specifies the efficiency of a planets troops 
in shooting down fighters during an attack. The number 
is used in a random function with an even spread between
5% and PLATTRF1+5%. On each attack the selected random
number of the attacking ships will be killed if there 
are a large number of troops on a planet.


PLATTRF1 {Max percent of fighters killed by troops: 18 } N 5 100

This value specifies the planets fighter kill ratio. 
It is the upper limit of a random function with a spread 
between 20% and PLATTRF2+20%. On each attack the selected
random ratio of attacking ships is killed. Example: If there
are 1000 fighters on the planet and 1500 attackers and the
random ratio selects 80% then 800 attackers are killed.
(1000 * .80)

PLATTRF2 {Max ratio of attackers killed by planet: 100 } N 5 1000

This ratio specifies the effectivness of the attacking
fighters. It is the upper limit of a random function 
with a spread between 20% and PLATTRF3+20%. On each 
attack the selected random ratio of planets fighters 
are killed. Example: if 1000 fighters attack a planet
with 1500 fighters and the random ratio selects 50% then
500 (1000 * 50%) of the planets fighters are killed.

PLATTRF3 {Max ratio of planet killed by attackers: 55 } N 5 1000

This value specifies the efficiency of a planets troops 
in killing attacking troops. The number is used in a 
random function with an even spread between 25% and 
PLATTRF1+25%. On each attack the selected random
number of the attacking troops will be killed if there 
are a large number of troops on a planet.


PLATTRT1 {Max percent of attackers killed by planet: 125 } N 5 1000

This value specifies the efficiency of the attacking
troops in killing planet troops. The number is used in a 
random function with an even spread between 10% and 
PLATTRF1+10%. On each attack the selected random
number of the planet troops will be killed if there 
are at least a 2 to 100 attacking ratio

EXPLAIN {
[1;36mIt is the Standard Year 3285, 1010 years since man developed interplanetary
space navigation, 447 years since neutron flux warp technology was perfected
by the ship builders of Zygor, and 35 years since the creation of the neutral
zone in the center of the galaxy by Zygor's Galactic Command.

Since the neutral zone was established and became the de facto marketplace
of the galaxy, ambitious individuals with piloting skills and some business
sense have traveled to Zygor to begin building their empires. Many of the
planets outside the neutral zone are ideal for establishing colonies and
producing goods.

The Zygorians will provide you with a small ship to begin your quest, but
it is up to you to procure the additional ships, weapons, colonists, and
supplies that you will need to build your empire. You can seek to establish
friendly relations with other ship commanders, or attempt to defeat them
in both ship-to-ship and planetary battles. A poorly defended colony can
be easily overrun and taken over by a commander eager to expand their
own empire at your expense.

Beware the dreaded Cybertrons, cybernetic automatons determined to destroy
all organic life in the galaxy. Since the Cybertron-Sarten War of 3274
decimated the Sarten Empire, the Cybertrons have greatly expanded their
power and reach. Cybertrons have no interest in planetary colonization
or diplomacy, your only option is to evade or destroy them.

Good luck!} T
