is capable of moving and sustaining the needs of the population of a small
planet. However, with all that space comes some limitations. The Planetary
Transport has no warp drive and is limited to impulse speeds. It has torpedo

[1;37mThe following information is from Zygor's sales catalog:

[1;36m"Have you ever heard it said that 'They don't make them like they used to'?
That's certainly the case when it comes to the MBM DREADNOUGHT, available from
Zygor. With phasers and shields upgradable to Mark-19, a warp 50 rated
engine with an amazing acceleration rate, and a full compliment of all the
offensive and defensive weapons systems available, you'll be partying like
it's 3250.

The MBM Dreadnought hasn't been in production for decades, as the demand for
larger cargo spaces has made this model and its relatively paltry 40,000-ton
capacity out of style. However, Zygor still has a few of these collector's
items in stock at the slightly inflated price of [0;33m32,000,000[1;36m each.

Fun fact: The MBM Dreadnought is named after a celebrated computer programmer
from 20th-century Earth whose code is still used in the interstellar flight
control systems of today."
