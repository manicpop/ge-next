[1;36mTopic: Start playing Galactic Empire 

When you begin playing Galactic Empire you are first given an Interceptor-class
ship. The Interceptor is ideal to begin your quest into the galaxy. You can
seek out an ideal planet to colonize, claim it, and transport down a basic
compliment of colonists and supplies.

After starting your colony, give it some time to grow. Your planet's population
will soon be large enough to generate taxes and put cash in your pocket. With
this cash you can purchase more powerful ships and additional goods to expand
your empire. 

Additionally, you can engage in combat with other ships. Cybertrons and other
automated ships are plentiful in the galaxy, and if you can destroy them you
will receive a portion of the goods they were carrying. Always be prepared for
battle (or to flee), as the more powerful your ship is, the more Cybertrons
will be dispatched to intercept you.

As far as other (real life) players in the galaxy, you can engage in combat
with them or try to build alliances. A sneak attack on an unsuspecting fellow
player might bring short term gains, but long term trouble.

Good luck and enjoy the game.

[1;36mTopic: Sector 

In each sector there may be between 0 and 9 planetary bodies. Each planet has
various environmental and resource qualities. The best planet has very good
resources and a very good environment.

Sector 0 0 is governed by the Galactic Command and is a declared neutral zone.
This policy is maintained by the Enforcer Planet. A single hostile action by
any player in this sector will be met with a swift and preemptive strike from
the Galactic Command's top secret weapons base on the Enforcer Planet.

Sector 0 0 also has the first planet Zygor, the leaders in state-of-the-art
weapons and ship hardware. Zygor manufactures the various ships and the weapons
they carry. It is also home of the Galactic Monetary Reserve Fund, the only
duly authorized financial institution in the galaxy.

Planet number two in Sector 0 0 is Tahanian Station, a embarking station for
colonists and mercenary soldiers. This is where you can find colonists eager
to find a new planet to live (and work) on, and purchase food supplies.

Once out of Sector 0 0 it is a free for all, and you have to decide how to
best defend yourself and your planets.

HLPCOMMU {
[1;36mTopic: Communications

Each ship has a communications console with three separate transmission
channels. You can set each to a specific channel or to the [1;37mHAIL[1;36m setting which
permits you to receive all general hailing messages. If you create alliances,
you can set one radio to an agreed upon channel and have a private and secure
communications path between members of your alliance. 

Use the [1;37mFREQ[1;36m command to change the communications frequency. 

Note that if the frequency is set above 20000 then it is determined to be a
hyperspace communications packet code and transmissions will be sent via
hyperspace to anyone with the same packet code anywhere in the galaxy.

HLPNAVIG {
[1;36mTopic: Moving (Navigating)
All directional information in Galactic Empire functions on a 360 degree
compass and is strictly two dimensional. The major bearings are illustrated
as follows:

       [1;37m315  0  45
          \ | /
           \|/

          / | \
       225 180 135[1;36m

BEARING -- Bearing is always used to indicate where a particular ship or planet
is in relation to you. It is relative to the direction you are facing and
expressed in a number from -179 to 180. If a object is bearing -90, it is to
the left of you, if 90 it is to the right of you, if 0 it is directly in front
of you, and if 180 it is directly behind you.

HEADING -- Heading is the relative direction of the other ship. It is used to
indicate when a ship is facing toward or away from you. A heading of 0 means
the ship is facing toward you, while a heading of 180 is away from you.

GALACTIC HEADING -- This is the absolute heading in the galaxy. A galactic
heading of 0 means you (or the other ship) is facing north up.

HLPPLANT {
[1;36mTopic: Owning planets

In order to build up wealth, you must colonize planets and maintain them.
Planets are claimed by simply going into orbit around one and using the [1;37mADMIN[1;36m
command. You should be choosy at first about which planets you put a population
on, as surviving on a poor planet can be very difficult and require frequent
supply runs.

Planets are rated on two factors, resources and environment, with the
following categories: POOR, MARGINAL, GOOD, and VERY GOOD. The resources factor
rates the natural resources of the planet. A rating of good or very good will
insure that your population has plenty of natural resources to use in the
establishment of the colony, and the manufacture of goods. The environment
factor rates the hospitality of the planet and how difficult it will be for a
colony to survive. A rating of good, or very good, will insure that the
majority of their efforts go toward producing goods and not simply surviving.

Once you have claimed a planet, you need to establish a population on
it. This is done with the [1;37mTRANSFER[1;36m command to shuttle items from your
ship to the planet.

[1;36mTopic: Owning planets (section 2)

It is a good idea to leave some additional items on a planet besides men. They
are:

FOOD -- If you fail to leave food on the planet you will find your men and
troops all dead when you return next time. It is a good idea to leave a case
for every 10 men & troops you have, and to make sure you produce enough so your
planet can sustain itself (see section 3).

TROOPS -- Troops are mercenaries, who produce nothing, but serve to defend your
planet from outside attacks and prevent domestic revolts. They must be fed
well, and will fight to the death when attacked.

FIGHTERS -- Fighters will defend your planet from both ground troop invasions
and fighter attacks. They provide a primary defense force for your planet.

ION CANNON -- This is a large defensive cannon which will attack any hostile
ship that is in orbit around your planet. It will fire once every few seconds,
and can destroy a ship in just a few blasts. An attacking ship won't stay long
with an ion cannon firing upon them. You can have multiple ion cannons, but
only one will be active at a time.

HLPPLAN3 {
[1;36mTopic: Owning planets (section 3)

There are several other factors you may adjust when you establish a planet.
When the planet is first established, your colony is instructed to divide
their efforts evenly between reproducing and growing food. You may wish to
instruct the colony to boost your planetary defenses or create weapons for
your or your team's use. Additionally, you can tax your planet at a specific
rate. The harsher the tax, the less the productivity. This tax is kept in the
planetary bank until you arrive to collect it.

Your colony will produce all the supplies you need for your ship if managed
properly. You can also choose to sell items to other commanders if you choose.
Any cash spent on goods from your planet goes into the planetary bank. Keeping
the planetary bank from going bankrupt will boost the production and maximum
capacity of your planet by 50 percent. Producing gold is another way to ensure
your planetary bank stays full.

If you wish to be selective in who can purchase from your planets, you can
establish a trade password for your planet and only those who know the password
can buy from you. This is also useful in establishing an alliance with other
players where you all would set your planets to the same password and agree on 
the price to charge each other. Non-members will be excluded from trading with
your alliance.

Remember that the better your planet, the more attractive it is to marauders.
Nothing can take the place of a well-rounded defense system and frequent supply
runs. Leaving a planet unchecked for more than a few days may spell disaster
for your colony.

HLPSTRAT {
[1;36mTopic: Game strategy

Your ship is equipped with nothing but a few flux pods when you first enter
the game, but you are not in any imminent danger as sector 0 0 is a neutral
zone. You are provided with an Interceptor and an amount of cash with which
you must decide what you are going to do.

On Zygor you can purchase shield systems, phaser systems, missiles, torpedoes,
jammers, decoys, mines, and zippers. Note: some of these may not be available
or useful on some ship classes (see [1;37mHELP CLASS[1;36m for more info). You can also
purchase fighters and ion cannons for your planets. On Tahanian Station you
can purchase colonists (men), troops, and food.

Your first goal should be to secure an income for yourself, and therefore
provide a source for taxes you will need to expand your empire, and keep your
ships fully stocked. To do this you should purchase men, troops, food, and some
fighters. Locate as good of a planet as you can find and colonize it. It is
advisable that you steer clear of other ships unless you know they are
friendly.

An alternative, albeit somewhat immoral, strategy is to purchase weapons and
lie waiting for other ships to leave sector 0 0. When they do, mount an attack.
Upon destroying their ship, you will gain what remains of the supplies on
their ship.

When you do colonize a planet you should redirect the majority of the effort to
producing men, food, and troops, and gaining cash with which you can purchase
larger and more powerful ships and expand your empire.

Remember, these are only a couple suggested strategies, and others are only
limited by your imagination.

HLPBATTL {
[1;36mTopic: Battle strategy

The flexibility of Galactic Empire precludes an exhaustive discussion of all
the strategies involved in user-versus-user battling. Some suggestions are
simply put forth here to get you started.

When in a potential battle situation make sure your shields are up, and keep
moving. The easiest target is a ship with shields down, sitting still.

If you have a cloaking system, use it sparingly as it consumes incredible
amounts of energy; it is most useful in covering a retreat.

If you have incoming torpedoes, you can ditch them easily by making a jump to
light speed (provided you have warp drive). This does not work for missiles
though, as they too can go through hyperspace.

Launching decoys does not guarantee that the incoming missiles or torpedoes
will be destroyed. Launching more decoys than incoming weapons increases the
chance of destroying an incoming weapon.

When launching an attack try to get close to the target and use the faster
torpedoes as they will have less time to react.

[1;37m} T 

HLPBATT2 {
[1;36mTopic: Battle strategy (section 2)

If a target goes to light speed, be prepared to make the jump with them and use
hyper-phasers as soon as you pass warp 1.

If you get hit with a hyper-phaser, immediately go into a series of high speed
turns as your opponent will have difficulty locating you. Go out of light speed
in another sector and immediately cloak as a last ditch effort to lose your
pursuers.

Form alliances to help protect each other from marauders. Remember, two ships
are twice as powerful as one.

When you are under attack you cannot exit the game to avoid your attackers. If
you disconnect while you are under attack your ship will be destroyed.
Remember, "death before dishonor!"

If you are damaged, try to make it back to sector 0 0 or to any populated
planet where you can get your ship repaired with the [1;37mMAINTENANCE[1;36m command.
Remember, the cost for everything is much more expensive in Sector 0 0.

When you destroy another ship, you will get some of the goods that were on that
ship. This can be very helpful when you are running low.

HLPBATT3 {
[1;36mTopic: Battle strategy (section 3, planetary battles)

Planets can defend themselves with troops, fighters, and ion cannons. If you
have no troops or fighters, your planet can be easily overrun.

FIGHTERS are Nova-class battle fighters commanded by a fully automated tactical
computer. They have inboard and outboard photon cannons capable of powerful and
offensive and defensive attacks. However, due to galactic treaty, fighters
launched from a ship are not programmed to attack troops stationed on a planet.

TROOPS are trained mercenaries, and serve no other function than the defense of
(or attack on) a planet. They consume food, maintain their skills, and mostly
play cards, but when needed they will fight to the death.

ION CANNONS are the very powerful fixed focus, ion-plasma transmitters, capable
of taking out a large ship with only a few strikes. They are strictly defensive
weapons controlled by a fully automated system. When the planet comes under
attack, they will automatically locate the attacker and commence firing upon
the ship.

When attacking a planet you are always at a disadvantage, as the local troops
and fighters are better supported and fresh. Knowing this, you should always
plan on commencing a battle with superior numbers.

If the planet has fighters, begin with a fighter attack. Clear out all fighters
from the planet before attempting to attack with troops. Once the fighters are
eliminated, you can begin attacking with troops.

After each wave, some fighters or troops may return to your ship if they are
not all eliminated in the attack. If you wish to send them back, you can do so.
Remember, you will not take a planet so long as 1 fighter or 1 squad of troops
(5) exists on the planet.

HLPCYBER {
[1;36mTopic: Cybertrons

Cybertrons are a race of automatons which are bent on the destruction of all
organic life from the universe. They command a class of ship manufactured
specifically for them, also called the Cybertron. Both pilot and ship function
as a single fighting unit, and they can be quite deadly.

The Cybertron is armed with phasers, and torpedoes, but has no missile
capability. They can be deadly in hyperspace with hyper-phasers, but cannot
recycle the phaser as fast as most other ships. Cybertrons are prone to battle
failure, and they will malfunction occasionally. This is often noted by strange
transmissions from their ship.

The top speed of a Cybertron Scout is warp 8.0, so they can be outrun with a
faster ship. They will however continue seeking, and if you stay too long in a
single spot, they will catch up. As you destroy Cybertrons and upgrade to more
powerful ships, you will find additional, more powerful classes of Cybertrons
will be dispatched to intercept you. It is up to you to discover the
capabilities of these ships.

HLPSCORE {
[1;36mTopic: Scoring

Scores are based upon the size of your empire and the number and class of kills
you have accumulated in ship-to-ship combat.  Each class of ship is worth a
different number of points.

Cybertron Scouts are worth 1000 points. More powerful Cybertrons are worth
more; you will have to destroy them to find how much.

Enter [1;37mHELP CLASS[1;36m to view the points awarded for destroying user ships.
Additionally, you are awarded a small percentage of the defeated player's score
in addition to the ship points.

Finally, when you destroy another player's ship, their score also goes down.
This means that you can actually knock players down on the top player list,
making it easier to overtake them (or pass them further).

HLPWORM {
[1;36mTopic: Wormholes

Wormholes are fairly rare galactic anomalies caused by a paired spatial
singularity. In effect, they create a means of "leaping" across the galaxy
to another sector. To navigate through a wormhole you must carefully approach
it directly at about 1/4 impulse. You will be pulled into the wormhole and
emerge at the terminal sector. If you approach too fast, you will simply miss
the event horizon. If you approach too slow, you may oscillate between terminal
sectors.

Each time you pass through a wormhole, some damage to systems may occur.
Passing through a wormhole while severely damaged is not recommended. Wormholes
are usually bidirectional, but an even rarer form of one way wormhole has been
speculated to exist.

HLPWAR {
[1;36mThe [1;37mWARP[1;36m command starts the warp drives (provided your type of ship has them)
and directs your course and speed. Issue the command as follows:

  [1;37mwarp [1;32m[speed] [heading]

  [1;32mspeed [1;36m= the warp speed

HLPZIP {
[1;36mThe [1;37mZIPPER[1;36m command launches a defensive (and sometimes offensive) weapon which
interferes with the timing mechanism on mines. The effect is to trip all mines
in the vicinity of the players ship into exploding immediately. This weapon can
be used to trip an opponent's mines after they have laid them but before they
can distance themself from them, causing the mines to do damage to the
opponent's own ship.

HLPTEA {
[1;36mThe [1;37mTEAM[1;36m command performs a number of functions related to teams. It allows
you to join a team, create a new team, leave a team, and get team scores.
Additionally, the team founder (or anyone with the founder password) can expel
a team member, change the team password, or change the team name.

Teams are identified by a 5 digit team code created by the founder when they
started the team. This code never changes even though the team name may be
changed. 

Team founder commands are:
[1;37m   team start [1;32mnnnnn ssssssssss pppppppppp [team name]
[1;36m      starts a new team with code [1;32mnnnnn[1;36m, founder password [1;32mssssssssss[1;36m, member
      password [1;32mpppppppppp[1;36m, and with the team name [1;32m[team name][1;36m.
[1;37m   team kick [1;32mssssssssss [user name]
[1;36m      permits a team member with the founder password to kick another team
      member off the team. If you don't also change the password the
      kicked player can simply rejoin.
[1;37m   team newpass [1;32mssssssssss pppppppppp
[1;36m      permits a team member with the founder password to assign a new member
      password [1;32mpppppppppp[1;36m.

HLPSPY {
[1;36mThe [1;37mSPY[1;36m command will transport a spy (provided you have one on board) to the
planet you are currently orbiting. If the spy survives and is not caught you
will from time to time get intellegence reports on the planet.

You can defend from spies by having your own spies on your planets. The more
trained spies you have, the better your chances you will catch any foreign
spies who sneak onto your planet.
