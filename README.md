# Galactic Empire ge-next

It is the Standard Year 3285, 1010 years since man developed interplanetary space navigation, 447 years since neutron flux warp technology was perfected by the ship builders of Zygor, and 35 years since the creation of the neutral
zone in the center of the galaxy by Zygor's Galactic Command.

Galactic Empire (GE) is a space exploration and conquest module for Worldgroup BBS systems written in C. ge-next is an effort to restart development, update, and refine the game.

## History

Galactic Empire was written by [Mike Murdock](https://github.com/mmurdock58) and originally released under the [GNU General Public License (GPLv2)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.en.html) in 2002. 

A [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/) [project](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnu-ge/) was setup in 2002 to house the GPLv2 version then moved to [GitHub](https://github.com/) in 2016.

The code was ported by [Bil Simser](https://github.com/bsimser) to Borland 5.01, Visual C++ 6, and the free Borland compiler after the Major BBS version was released by Mike.

ge-next began in 2024 by [Anthony Schmidt](https://github.com/manicpop).
